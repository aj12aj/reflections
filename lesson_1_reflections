Lesson 1 reflections
Finding differences between codes is easier with "diff -u" command.
Github is for saving previous versions of the file you are editing.
The entire history of the file would show which was changed at which point in time leading to an easier detection of what went wrong.
being able to choose when to save may sometimes result to failure to save in case of sudden program shutdown. 
Version control systems may more specifically show the differences between each editing stage so finding bugs will be more efficient and easier.
